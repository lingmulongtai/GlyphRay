# macOS Host

macOS support is Phase 2. The repository includes a Swift Package shell in `hosts/macos-host`.

## Planned Native APIs

- UI: SwiftUI
- Screen capture: ScreenCaptureKit
- Video encoding: VideoToolbox
- Input: CGEvent for mouse and keyboard first
- Secrets: Keychain

## Pen Support

Native Windows Ink-style pen injection is Windows-specific. macOS can support pointer, keyboard, and possibly tablet-event-compatible paths later, but the initial macOS host should not claim Windows Ink parity.

## Build

```bash
cd hosts/macos-host
swift build
```
